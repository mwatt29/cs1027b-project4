# What This Project Does
This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a Binary Search Tree Collection. It provides functionality to:

Build and manipulate individual binary search trees.
Manage collections of trees for advanced operations like merging, structural equivalence checks, and total node counting.
Features of the Project
Binary Search Tree (BST):

TreeNode Class:

Represents individual nodes in the BST with:
An integer value.
References to the left and right child nodes.
BinarySearchTree Class:

Implements the core functionality of a BST:
Add Node: Inserts a value into the tree while maintaining the BST property.
Get Node Count: Counts the total number of nodes in the tree.
Breadth-First Search (BFS) Traversal: Retrieves node values level-by-level.
Contains Node: Checks whether a given value exists in the tree.
Get Height: Calculates the height of the tree.
Binary Search Tree Collection:

Tree Management:

Add, delete, and retrieve trees by index.
Retrieve the total number of trees in the collection.
Advanced Operations:

Structural Equivalence: Checks if specified trees have the same structure and node values.
Merge Trees: Combines multiple trees into a single BST by consolidating and sorting all unique values.
Total Node Count: Calculates the total number of nodes across all trees in the collection.

Expected Output:

Total number of nodes across trees.
Results of structural equivalence checks.
Updates to the collection after merging trees.
Technologies/Libraries Used
Language: Java
Core Libraries:
java.util: For ArrayList, HashSet, Queue, and Collections.


This project demonstrates skills in:

Implementing and managing data structures (BST).
Recursive programming for tree traversal and manipulation.
Advanced operations on collections of objects (structural equivalence and merging).
Problem-solving and OOP principles.
